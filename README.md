This code provides a Google Cloud Function that performs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process triggered by events in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The function processes Excel files stored in the bucket, performs transformations, and generates fact and dimensional tables. These tables are then written into Google BigQuery tables.
